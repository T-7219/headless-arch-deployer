A robust, interactive shell script for deploying minimalist Arch Linux installations with BTRFS filesystem and proper subvolume layout. The script automates the entire installation process while maintaining flexibility through interactive configuration options. Designed to work specifically with UEFI boot mode.

## üöÄ Features

- **Streamlined Installation**: Fully automated Arch Linux setup from live environment
- **Filesystem Optimization**: BTRFS with optimal subvolume layout (@, @home, @var, @snapshots)
- **UEFI Required**: Optimized specifically for systems with UEFI firmware
- **Storage Flexibility**: Interactive disk selection with safety confirmations
- **Network Ready**: DHCP configuration and optional SSH server setup
- **User-Friendly**: Interactive prompts with sensible defaults
- **Enhanced Security**: Proper user creation with sudo privileges
- **System Maintenance**: Automatic mirror optimization with reflector
- **Performance Tuning**: BTRFS compression with zstd and noatime options

## üîß Usage

1. Boot into an Arch Linux live environment with UEFI mode enabled
2. Download the script:
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/T-7219/headless-arch-deployer/raw/main/archinstall.en.sh
```

3. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x archinstall.en.sh
```

4. Run the script:
```bash
./archinstall.en.sh
```

5. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your installation
